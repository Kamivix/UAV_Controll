# UAV_Controll

This is my engineering thesis. The subject of the following engineering thesis is the control of unmanned aerial vehicles by means of the movement of the hands.
All code was written in C language. Main components of this project: Arduino Nano, nrf24l01 and Mpu6050. Nrf24l01 was used to provide wireless communication between two arduino boards. The MPu 6050 was used to read the hand position.
